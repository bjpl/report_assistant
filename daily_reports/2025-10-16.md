## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Python-Based CLI Tool

**Context**: Needed robust CLI interface for report management with file operations, Git integration, and data processing

**Options Considered**:
1. **Bash Script** - Pros: Simple, no dependencies; Cons: Limited data structures, complex logic hard to maintain
2. **Python CLI** - Pros: Rich ecosystem, argparse library, easy data manipulation; Cons: Python dependency required
3. **Node.js CLI** - Pros: JavaScript familiarity, npm ecosystem; Cons: Heavier runtime, async complexity

**Decision**: Python-based CLI tool with argparse

**Rationale**:
- Python 3.11+ already in technology stack
- Excellent file and text processing capabilities
- Argparse provides clean subcommand structure
- Rich standard library for Git integration
- Easy to extend and maintain
- Strong string and data manipulation

**Trade-offs**: Requires Python installation but provides superior maintainability and feature richness

---

### Decision 2: Makefile for Build Automation

**Context**: Required standardized build and automation interface

**Options Considered**:
1. **NPM Scripts Only** - Pros: JavaScript ecosystem native; Cons: Limited shell integration, verbose
2. **Makefile** - Pros: Universal, concise, powerful; Cons: Requires make installation
3. **Shell Scripts** - Pros: Simple, portable; Cons: No dependency management, verbose

**Decision**: Makefile as primary automation interface

**Rationale**:
- Universal standard across all platforms
- Concise target syntax with dependencies
- Excellent for orchestrating multiple tools
- Self-documenting with help targets
- Strong community familiarity
- Perfect for CLI tool integration

**Trade-offs**: Requires make installation but provides industry-standard automation interface

---

### Decision 3: Dual Interface (CLI + Aliases)

**Context**: Need both scriptable interface and interactive shortcuts

**Options Considered**:
1. **CLI Only** - Pros: Single interface, consistent; Cons: Verbose for interactive use
2. **Aliases Only** - Pros: Fast interactive use; Cons: Not scriptable, hard to discover
3. **Dual System** - Pros: Best of both worlds; Cons: Maintenance overhead

**Decision**: Implement both full CLI tool and comprehensive shell aliases

**Rationale**:
- CLI provides scriptable, documented interface
- Aliases optimize for interactive developer workflow
- Aliases built on top of CLI ensure consistency
- Different use cases benefit from different interfaces
- Minimal maintenance overhead with alias generation

**Trade-offs**: Slight complexity increase but significantly improved user experience for both interactive and automated use

---

### Decision 4: Installation Automation Script

**Context**: Onboarding and setup process needed to be streamlined

**Options Considered**:
1. **Manual Setup** - Pros: Simple, no script needed; Cons: Error-prone, time-consuming
2. **Basic Install Script** - Pros: Automated basic setup; Cons: May miss edge cases
3. **Comprehensive Install Script** - Pros: Complete automation, validation; Cons: More complex to maintain

**Decision**: Comprehensive installation script with validation and testing

**Rationale**:
- One-command setup improves onboarding
- Automated validation catches environment issues
- Shell profile integration enables immediate use
- Testing post-install ensures working environment
- Reduced support burden from setup issues

**Trade-offs**: More complex script but dramatically improved setup experience
