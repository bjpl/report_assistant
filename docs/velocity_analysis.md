## 9. Bottleneck Identification

### Development Velocity Bottlenecks

**1. Multi-Day Gaps (Critical Bottleneck)**

| Project | Primary Gap | Impact | Root Cause Hypothesis |
|---------|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| California | 6 days (Sep 28-Oct 4) | Momentum loss, -74.7% velocity drop | Post-sprint recovery |
| Colombia | 9 days (Sep 25-Oct 4) | Critical stall, -91.5% velocity loss | Context switching to California |
| Aves | 17 days (Sep 15-Oct 2) | Project near-abandonment | Prototype evaluation period |

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Reduce gap threshold to 4 days
- Implement daily check-in commits
- Set calendar-based milestones

---

**2. Context Switching (High Impact)**

**Evidence:**
```
Sep 18-25: Colombia peak (183 commits)
Sep 26-27: Gap on both projects
Sep 28-Oct 4: Gap continues
Oct 5: Aves massive activity (56 commits)
```

**Analysis:**
- Serial project focus rather than parallel
- High switching cost (6-9 day gaps)
- Loss of momentum between switches

**Cost:** Estimated 20-25 days of gap time across 3 projects

**Recommendation:**
- Timebox parallel work (e.g., 2hr blocks per project)
- Use feature flags for incremental work
- Maintain daily commit streaks

---

**3. Late-Stage Velocity Collapse (Medium Impact)**

**Pattern Across Projects:**
- Week 1: 100% velocity (baseline)
- Week 2-3: 50-150% velocity (peak)
- Week 4+: 10-20% velocity (refinement)

**California Example:**
- W38: 105 commits (peak)
- W41: 20 commits (-80.9%)

**Colombia Example:**
- W37: 156 commits (peak)
- W41: 5 commits (-96.8%)

**Root Cause:** Natural completion curve, but steeper than optimal

**Impact:**
- Reduced iteration capacity in final phase
- Potential quality/polish limitations

**Recommendation:**
- Reserve 30% velocity budget for final week
- Use Week 3 as refinement start (not Week 4)
- Implement rolling completion (finish features progressively)

---

**4. Infrastructure Setup Overhead (Low-Medium Impact)**

**Evidence:**
- California Day 1: "Add GitHub Pages deployment"
- Both projects: Multiple Supabase integration branches
- Aves: Likely 17-day gap due to infrastructure decisions

**Time Investment:**
- Deployment setup: ~1-2 days (estimated from initial commits)
- Supabase integration: ~7 days (branch lifecycle)
- Documentation infrastructure: ~1-2 days

**Total Overhead:** ~10-15% of project time

**Assessment:**
- Necessary investment
- Reusable across projects (Supabase pattern repeated)
- **Not a bottleneck, but optimization opportunity**

**Recommendation:**
- Create infrastructure templates
- Parallel infrastructure setup during planning phase
- Reuse patterns across similar projects (both puzzle games could share)

---

**5. Documentation Debt (Medium Impact)**

**Week 41 Documentation Sprint:**
- Oct 11: Coordinated 4-repository documentation standardization
- California: "feature/daily-reports-standardization"
- Colombia: "feature/daily-reports-standardization"
- Aves: "align-daily-reports-execution", "align-reports-aves"

**Analysis:**
- Documentation deferred to project end
- Required dedicated sprint (lower feature velocity)
- Cross-project coordination needed (4 repos)

**Impact:**
- Delayed feature work in Week 41
- Context switching cost
- Potential retroactive documentation quality issues

**Recommendation:**
- Document-as-you-build approach
- Daily report automation
- Template standardization upfront

---

**6. Parallel Repository Scalability (Low Impact, Future Risk)**

**Current State:**
- 45 total repositories
- 3-4 active simultaneously
- Coordination challenges evident (Oct 11 sprint)

**Observed Limits:**
- Effective parallel work: 2 repositories (Sep 20-21)
- Coordination overhead kicks in: 3+ repositories (Oct 11)
- Serial focus preferred: 1 repository sprints (Aves Oct 5)

**Future Risk:**
- Scaling to 5+ active projects will hit coordination bottleneck
- Current patterns unsustainable at higher scale

**Recommendation:**
- Limit active projects to 3 maximum
- Use monorepo for related projects (puzzle games)
- Implement shared tooling/templates

---

### Bottleneck Priority Matrix

| Bottleneck | Impact | Frequency | Effort to Fix | Priority |
|------------|--------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Multi-day gaps | Critical | High | Medium | **P0** |
| Context switching | High | High | High | **P1** |
| Late-stage velocity collapse | Medium | High | Medium | **P1** |
| Documentation debt | Medium | Medium | Low | **P2** |
| Infrastructure overhead | Low-Med | Medium | Medium | **P2** |
| Parallel scalability | Low | Low | High | **P3** |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0)
1. **Reduce Multi-Day Gaps:** Implement daily commit minimum (even documentation/planning)
2. **Gap Alert System:** Automated reminder after 2 days of repository inactivity
3. **Velocity Monitoring:** Weekly velocity review to catch decline early

### Short-Term Improvements (P1)
4. **Context Switching Protocol:** Define timebox for multi-repo work (e.g., 2-hour blocks)
5. **Progressive Completion:** Start Week 3 refinement to avoid Week 4 collapse
6. **Parallel Work Optimization:** Limit to 2-3 active repositories maximum

### Long-Term Optimization (P2-P3)
7. **Documentation Automation:** Daily report generation, standardized templates
8. **Infrastructure Templates:** Reusable deployment/auth patterns
9. **Monorepo Consideration:** Evaluate for related projects (puzzle games)
10. **Velocity Forecasting:** Build predictive models based on current patterns

## Appendix: Data Collection Methodology

### Git Commands Used
```bash
# Weekly velocity
git log --since="2024-08-01" --format="%ad" --date=format:'%Y-%W' --all | sort | uniq -c

# Daily activity
git log --since="2024-08-01" --format="%ad" --date=short --all | sort | uniq -c

# Commit gaps
git log --since="2024-08-01" --format="%ai" --all | awk '{print $1}' | sort -u

# Branch analysis
git branch -a --format="%(refname:short)|%(authordate:iso)|%(subject)"
git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/ --format='%(refname:short)|%(committerdate:relative)'

# Conventional commits
git log --format="%s" --all | grep -E "^(feat|fix|chore|docs):" | cut -d':' -f1 | sort | uniq -c

# Project lifecycle
git log --reverse --since="2024-08-01" --format="%ai|%s" --all | head -1
git log --since="2024-08-01" --format="%ai|%s" --all | head -1
```

### Analysis Period
- **Start Date:** August 1, 2024 (for comparison, actual activity September 2025+)
- **End Date:** October 18, 2025
- **Primary Focus:** September 15 - October 17, 2025

### Repositories Analyzed
- **Primary:** california_puzzle_game, colombia_puzzle_game, aves, report_assistant
- **Total Workspace:** 45 repositories
- **Active Projects:** 4 with significant commit history

---

**Analysis Completed:** October 18, 2025
**Next Review:** Recommend weekly velocity monitoring
**Tooling:** Git log analysis with bash scripting
