## Remaining Issues (19 invalid reports in 2 projects)

### 1. brandonjplambert (9 invalid)

Reports exist but no commits found in brandonjplambert folder:
- 2025-09-01, 09-03, 09-04, 09-06, 09-07, 09-10, 09-11, 09-12, 10-06

**Analysis**: These dates likely have commits in a SEPARATE portfolio git repository (not in the monorepo).

**Recommendation**:
- **Option A**: Check if portfolio site is in separate repo and keep reports
- **Option B**: Delete if these reports were created by mistake

---

### 2. letratos (10 invalid)

Reports exist but no commits found in letratos folder:
- 2025-08-30, 08-31, 09-01, 09-03, 09-04, 09-05, 09-06, 09-10, 09-11, 09-12

**Analysis**: Only 10 commits in letratos folder but 20 reports exist.

**Recommendation**: **INVESTIGATE** - These reports may document work done elsewhere or planning sessions.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Validation Script ✓
**Before**: Didn't work with monorepo (checked for `.git` in each project)
**After**: Works perfectly with monorepo (uses `git log -- .` path filter)

**Deleted**: 39 duplicates total
- brandonjplambert work in video_gen/describe_it
- colombia_puzzle_game work in video_gen
- hablas work in video_gen

### 3. Placeholder Reports ✓
