# Authentication Implementation Report

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Projects with Authentication:** 7 confirmed implementations  
**Authentication Providers:** Supabase Auth, NextAuth.js, JWT/OAuth2, Custom Sessions  
**Coverage:** Educational games, learning platforms, business intelligence

---

## Overview

This document details authentication and authorization implementations across portfolio projects. Authentication methods range from OAuth integration with Supabase to custom JWT implementations with role-based access control (RBAC).

---

## Summary of All 7 Projects with Authentication

### Supabase Auth (3 projects):
1. **Describe It** - Multi-provider OAuth (Google, GitHub), magic links
2. **California Puzzle** - Optional auth for progress tracking  
3. **Colombia Puzzle** - Supabase Auth with @supabase/auth-ui-react components

### Custom JWT (2 projects):
4. **Corporate Intel** - Enterprise JWT with comprehensive RBAC system (admin/analyst/viewer/service roles)
5. **Open Learn** - FastAPI JWT auth with python-jose and passlib/bcrypt

### Express Sessions (1 project):
6. **AVES** - PostgreSQL-backed sessions with bcrypt hashing (10 rounds)

### NextAuth.js (1 project):
7. **Hablas** - Admin authentication with JWT strategy

---

## Key Implementations

### Corporate Intel - Most Sophisticated
- Full RBAC with 4 user roles (admin, analyst, viewer, service)
- 15+ permission scopes (read:companies, write:metrics, manage:users, etc.)
- API key authentication with SHA-256 hashing
- Rate limiting per role (1,000-50,000 requests/day)
- Session tracking with JWT IDs
- Password complexity validation

### Open Learn - Production-Ready
- OAuth2 password bearer flow
- JWT access + refresh tokens
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Rate limiting middleware
- Security headers
- OWASP Top 10 tested

### Hablas - Admin Portal
- NextAuth.js with Credentials provider
- JWT session strategy (24-hour expiry)
- Role-based authorization
- Environment-based credentials

---

## Common Security Patterns

**All projects implement:**
- Minimum 8-character passwords
- Bcrypt hashing (10-12 rounds)
- HTTPS-only cookies in production
- HTTP-only cookie flags
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Token expiration management

**Token Refresh Flow:**
1. Access token (1 hour) + Refresh token (7 days)
2. Auto-refresh on expiry
3. Token rotation for security
