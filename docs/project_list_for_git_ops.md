## Git Operations Workflow

### Phase 1: Status Check
For each project:
```bash
cd [project_path]
git status --porcelain
```

### Phase 2: Identify Changes
Check if README.md appears in git status output

### Phase 3: Stage and Commit
For projects with README changes:
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: Update README with current project status and accurate information

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Phase 4: Summary
Document all commits in:
- /mnt/c/Users/brand/Development/Project_Workspace/active-development/report_assistant/docs/readme_commit_summary.md

### Phase 5: Prepare Push Commands
Create push command list for manual review (DO NOT auto-execute)
