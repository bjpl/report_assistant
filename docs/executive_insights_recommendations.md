| **algorithms_and_data_structures** | 🔴 Critical | 1,146 debt markers, no CI/CD, 70 large files | Emergency cleanup sprint + CI/CD | 8 weeks |
| **colombia_puzzle_game** | 🟡 Warning | 272 MB bundle, 197 debt markers | Bundle optimization + debt cleanup | 4 weeks |
| **corporate_intel** | 🟢 Good | Enterprise-grade, needs scale testing | Performance benchmarking + load testing | 4 weeks |
| **describe_it** | 🟢 Good | Bleeding edge (React 19), needs stability monitoring | Observability enhancement | 2 weeks |

**Tier 2: MAINTAIN MOMENTUM (Continue Well)**

| Project | Status | Why Performing Well | Recommended Action | Timeline |
|---------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| **california_puzzle_game** | 🟢 Good | 489 debt markers, but strong testing, good velocity | Debt reduction to <100 markers | 6 weeks |
| **aves** | 🟢 Good | Excellent bundle size (304 KB), stable velocity | Add integration tests | 3 weeks |
| **hablas** | 🟢 Good | Next.js 15, solid stack, educational value | Maintain current approach | Ongoing |
| **online_language_learning_resources** | 🟢 Excellent | Zero debt markers, clean codebase | Gold standard - no changes | Ongoing |

**Tier 3: SUNSET/ARCHIVE (Consider Retirement)**

| Project | Rationale | Decision | Action |
|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **brandonjplambert** | Personal portfolio, 5 commits since Aug 2024 | Archive or maintenance mode | Freeze dependencies, occasional updates |
| **fancy_monkey** | 15 commits total, unclear purpose | Evaluate strategic value | Archive if no active development plan |
| **internet** | 8 commits total, minimal activity | Low priority | Maintenance mode only |
| **agentic_learning** | 11 commits total, limited scope | Merge with learning_agentic_engineering? | Consolidate or archive |

**Tier 4: STRATEGIC GROWTH (Scale Up)**

| Project | Opportunity | Recommended Investment | Expected Outcome |

| **language-learning suite** (hablas, aves, online_language_learning) | Monorepo consolidation | 120 hours engineering | Shared components, faster development |
| **Puzzle games** (california, colombia) | Extract shared library | 80 hours engineering | Reusable puzzle engine |
| **corporate_intel** | Enterprise customer acquisition | 200 hours feature development + sales | Revenue generation |

**Optimal Concurrent Project Load:**

**Data-Driven Recommendation:** **Maximum 3 active projects simultaneously**

**Analysis:**
- 2-project parallel work: High success (Sep 20-21, 92 commits/day sustained)
- 3-4 project coordination: Context switching overhead appears (Oct 11, 47 commits across 4 repos)
- Single-project focus: Best velocity (Aves Oct 5, 56 commits/day)

**Optimal Pattern:**
```yaml
Active Projects (3 max):
  Primary Focus (60% time): 1 project
    - Example: algorithms_and_data_structures cleanup

  Secondary Focus (30% time): 1 project
    - Example: colombia_puzzle_game optimization

  Maintenance/Quick Wins (10% time): 1 project
    - Example: hablas minor updates

Staged Approach:
  Months 1-2: Focus on algorithms_and_data_structures (Tier 1 critical)
  Months 3-4: Focus on colombia_puzzle_game + california_puzzle_game
  Months 5-6: Focus on corporate_intel growth

Context Switching Protocol:
  - 2-hour focused blocks per project
  - Daily standup: Review all 3 projects (15 min total)
  - Weekly: Adjust priorities based on velocity
```

**Project Start/Stop Criteria:**

**START new project if:**
- < 3 projects currently active
- Clear strategic value (customer demand, revenue, learning)
- Minimum 8-week commitment available
- Resources available (CI/CD, monitoring, testing)

**STOP/PAUSE project if:**
- Velocity drops <10 commits/week for 2 consecutive weeks
- Critical blocker (waiting for external dependency)
- Merge with more active project possible
- Strategic value unclear

**Resource Allocation Formula:**

```
Weekly Time Budget: 40 hours development time

Allocation:
  Active development: 28 hours (70%)
    - Primary project: 17 hours
    - Secondary project: 8 hours
    - Tertiary project: 3 hours

  Technical debt: 6 hours (15%)

  Learning/Innovation: 4 hours (10%)

  Meetings/Planning: 2 hours (5%)
```

**Success Metrics:**
- Active projects: ≤3 at any time
- Average project velocity: ≥15 commits/week
- Context switching gaps: ≤2 days between commits
- Project completion rate: ≥80% (finish what you start)

**Priority Score: P0** (Critical for Sustainable Development)

### Pattern 5: Zero Technical Debt (online_language_learning_resources) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**What Made It Successful:**

**1. Clean Codebase Maintenance**
- **Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK markers** (only project with 0)
- Minimal dependencies (Jekyll static site)
- Fast deployment
- Low maintenance overhead

**Why This Works:**
- Decisions made immediately (no "TODO: decide later")
- Complete features or remove them (no half-implementations)
- Simple architecture (static site, no complexity)
- Regular cleanup (never let debt accumulate)

**How to Replicate:**

```yaml
"Zero Debt Policy" Implementation:

1. Pre-Commit Hook (Block New Debt)
   #!/bin/bash
   # .husky/pre-commit

   # Block commits with TODO/FIXME in production code
   if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E '\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx|py)$' | xargs grep -l "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK" > /dev/null; then
     echo "❌ Commit blocked: TODO/FIXME/HACK found in production code"
     echo "Create a GitHub Issue instead, then reference it in a comment"
     exit 1
   fi

2. GitHub Issue Requirement
   Instead of: // TODO: Implement authentication
   Use: // Issue #123: Implement authentication

   Benefits:
   - Debt is tracked (GitHub Issues)
   - Can be prioritized and scheduled
   - No forgotten TODOs in codebase

3. Weekly Debt Review
   - Every Friday: Review all open Issues tagged "technical-debt"
   - Close completed items
   - Reprioritize remaining
   - Allocate 20% next week's capacity to highest priority

4. Complete or Delete
   - Feature not ready? Don't commit half-implementation
   - Experiment failed? Delete the code, document decision (ADR)
   - Feature works? Complete it fully, including tests and docs

5. Simplicity Bias
   - Prefer simple solutions over complex
   - Avoid premature optimization
   - Delete unused code immediately
   - Minimize dependencies

Time to Implement: 4 hours (pre-commit hook + process documentation)
Projects to Apply: All projects (portfolio-wide standard)
Expected Impact: Zero new technical debt, existing debt tracked properly
```

### Pattern 6: Sustained Velocity (aves vs puzzle games) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**What Made Aves Different:**

**Velocity Comparison:**
```
California Puzzle Game:
  Week 1 → Week 4: -80.0% decline

Colombia Puzzle Game:
  Week 1 → Week 4: -92.8% decline

Aves:
  Week 1 → Week 4: -7.4% decline ✨ (stable)
```

**Why Aves Maintained Velocity:**

1. **17-Day Prototype Evaluation Period**
   - Sep 15: Initial commit (27 commits)
   - Sep 16-Oct 1: Development pause (evaluation)
   - Oct 2+: Committed development (119 commits)

   **Lesson:** Don't rush into full development. Validate concept first.

2. **Steady Progress Pattern**
   - No extreme peak week (highest: 61 commits in Week 3)
   - Distributed work across 4 weeks
   - Avoided sprint exhaustion

   **Lesson:** Marathon pace beats sprint pace for sustainability.

3. **Active Main Branch (16-hour freshness)**
   - Main branch updated within 16 hours (vs 2 days for others)
   - Frequent integration
   - Less merge conflict risk

   **Lesson:** Integrate early and often.

4. **Shorter Branch Lifecycles (3-7 days vs 7-10 days)**
   - align-daily-reports-execution: 7 days
   - align-reports-aves: 7 days
   - Faster feedback loops

   **Lesson:** Small, focused branches merged quickly.

**How to Replicate:**

```yaml
"Sustained Velocity" Pattern:

Phase 1: Validation (Week 0-1)
  - Build minimal prototype (1-2 days)
  - Evaluate feasibility (1-2 weeks)
  - Decision: Commit or pivot

  If commit:
    - Set realistic timeline (4-8 weeks)
    - Define MVP scope clearly
    - Allocate resources

Phase 2: Steady Development (Weeks 1-3)
  - Target: 100-150% of baseline velocity (not 300%)
  - Daily progress (minimum 1 commit/day)
  - Small, frequent PRs (merge within 48 hours)
  - Continuous integration (don't let branches diverge)

Phase 3: Refinement (Week 4+)
  - Start refinement in Week 3 (not Week 4)
  - Maintain 50-70% velocity (not 10-20%)
  - Polish, testing, documentation
  - Avoid cramming at the end

Velocity Targets:
  Week 1: 100% (baseline)
  Week 2: 120-150% (productive peak)
  Week 3: 80-100% (refinement starts)
  Week 4+: 50-70% (polish, maintain momentum)

Avoid Anti-Patterns:
  ❌ Week 1 sprint explosion (200%+ velocity)
  ❌ Multi-week gaps (>3 days)
  ❌ Deferred testing/documentation
  ❌ "Big bang" completion in final week

Time to Implement: Process change (no technical work)
Projects to Apply: All future projects
Expected Impact: +60% final week velocity, -50% burnout
```

  "packageRules": [
    {
      "matchUpdateTypes": ["patch"],
      "automerge": true,
      "automergeType": "pr",
      "platformAutomerge": true
    },
    {
      "matchUpdateTypes": ["minor"],
      "groupName": "all non-major dependencies",
      "groupSlug": "all-minor-patch"
    },
    {
      "matchUpdateTypes": ["major"],
      "enabled": false
    }
  ],
  "vulnerabilityAlerts": {
    "enabled": true,
