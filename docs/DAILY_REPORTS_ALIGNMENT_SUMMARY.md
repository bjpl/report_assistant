## 4. Templates Created

**CRITICAL: Understanding the TWO Types of Reports**

This project uses **TWO DISTINCT** reporting systems with different purposes, templates, and directory locations:

### Report Type 1: Daily Progress Reports (`/daily_reports/`)

**Purpose:** Post-session progress tracking - what you accomplished today
**Location:** `/daily_reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
**Template:** `daily_report_template.md`
**Based on:** describe_it template structure
**Frequency:** After each development session (typically daily)
**Focus:** Features built, bugs fixed, technical decisions made

**Key Characteristics:**
- Written AFTER work is complete
- Documents what was accomplished
- Tracks session-specific progress
- Links to commits and PRs
- Focuses on deliverables

### Report Type 2: GMS Startup Reports (`/daily_dev_startup_reports/`)

**Purpose:** Pre-session strategic audit - comprehensive project health check
**Location:** `/daily_dev_startup_reports/YYYY-MM-DD_startup_report.md`
**Template:** `gms_startup_report_template.md` (NEW - to be created)
**Based on:** video_gen 8-checkpoint GMS methodology
**Frequency:** Daily at session start (or weekly for smaller projects)
**Focus:** Project health, blockers, technical debt, strategic planning

**Key Characteristics:**
- Written BEFORE work begins
- Audits entire project health
- Uses 8 mandatory GMS checkpoints
- Generates alternative plans (A, B, C, D, E)
- Drives strategic decision-making

### Report Type 3: Strategic Audits (Quarterly/Major Milestones)

**Purpose:** Deep strategic review for major milestones
**Location:** `/docs/audits/` or `/daily_dev_startup_reports/` (for major reviews)
**Template:** `strategic_audit_template.md` (formerly startup_report_template.md)
**Based on:** Enterprise audit best practices
**Frequency:** Quarterly, phase transitions, or major incidents
**Focus:** Architecture, security, performance, resource planning

---

### Template 1: Daily Development Report

**Location:** `/docs/templates/daily_report_template.md`

**Purpose:** Post-session progress tracking (what you built today)

**Sections:**
1. Executive Summary (Status, Health Score, Key Metrics)
2. Commit Activity (Timeline with visual indicators)
3. Features Implemented
4. Bug Fixes & Issues
5. Technical Decisions
6. Challenges & Solutions
7. Metrics & Statistics
8. Next Steps

**Usage:**
```bash
# Copy template for today's work
cp docs/templates/daily_report_template.md daily_reports/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md

# Fill in what you accomplished this session
# Focus on deliverables, features, and progress
```

**When to Use:**
- After completing a development session
- To document what was built/fixed
- To track daily progress toward milestones
- To maintain project timeline

---

### Template 2: GMS Startup Report (8-Checkpoint Methodology)

**Location:** `/docs/templates/gms_startup_report_template.md` ✅ CREATED

**Purpose:** Pre-session comprehensive project health audit

**8 Mandatory GMS Checkpoints:**
1. **[MANDATORY-GMS-1]** Daily Report Audit - Coverage analysis, missing reports
2. **[MANDATORY-GMS-2]** Code Annotation Scan - TODOs, FIXMEs, HACKs prioritized
3. **[MANDATORY-GMS-3]** Uncommitted Work Analysis - Git status review
4. **[MANDATORY-GMS-4]** Issue Tracker Review - Open issues prioritized
5. **[MANDATORY-GMS-5]** Technical Debt Assessment - Debt score and critical items
6. **[MANDATORY-GMS-6]** Project Status Reflection - Current state analysis
7. **[MANDATORY-GMS-7]** Alternative Plans Proposal - Plans A, B, C, D, E with effort/risk
8. **[MANDATORY-GMS-8]** Recommendation with Rationale - Chosen approach + execution strategy

**Usage:**
```bash
# Generate GMS audit at session start
cp docs/templates/gms_startup_report_template.md \
   daily_dev_startup_reports/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_startup_report.md

# Run automated analysis (if available)
python scripts/generate_gms_audit.py

# Review all 8 checkpoints and choose Plan A/B/C/D/E
```

**When to Use:**
- At the START of each development session (daily or weekly)
- Before making strategic decisions
- When project feels stuck or unclear
- To identify technical debt and blockers
- To generate alternative approaches

**Purpose:** Deep strategic review for major milestones or quarterly audits

**Sections:**
1. Executive Summary
2. Audit Scope & Objectives
3. Strategic Assessment (10 dimensions)
4. Risk Analysis
5. Strategic Recommendations
6. Resource & Budget Implications
7. Success Metrics & KPIs

**Usage:**
```bash
# Generate quarterly or milestone audit
cp docs/templates/strategic_audit_template.md \
   docs/audits/Q4-2025-strategic-audit.md

# Conduct deep analysis across all project dimensions
# Include stakeholder interviews, metrics dashboards, security scans

## 7. Next Steps & Recommendations

### For Report Authors

1. **New Daily Reports:**
   ```bash
   # Use the daily report template
   cp docs/templates/daily_report_template.md daily_reports/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
   # Fill in sections, preserve formatting
   ```

2. **Startup/Audit Reports:**
   ```bash
   # Use comprehensive startup template
   cp docs/templates/startup_audit_template.md \
      daily_dev_startup_reports/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_startup_report.md
   # Run analysis tools, add insights
   ```

3. **Specialized Projects:**
   - **Business-focused:** Add Business Intelligence Extension
   - **Creative projects:** Add Design System Extension
   - **Learning/Research:** Add Experiment Results Extension

### Automation Opportunities

1. **Automated Startup Reports:**
   ```python
   # scripts/generate_startup_report.py
   - Git log analysis for commit activity
   - TODO/FIXME scanning (GMS-2)
   - Git status for uncommitted work (GMS-3)
   - Issue tracker integration (GMS-4)
   - Code metrics for technical debt (GMS-5)
   ```

2. **Daily Report Generation:**
   ```python
   # scripts/generate_daily_report.py
   - Extract commit messages for the day
   - Analyze file changes (insertions/deletions)
   - Group commits by feature/fix/docs
   - Generate formatted markdown
   ```

3. **Compliance Checking:**
   ```python
   # scripts/check_report_compliance.py
   - Verify all mandatory sections present
   - Check formatting conventions
   - Validate emoji/indicator usage
   - Report missing elements
   ```

### Quality Assurance Process

1. **Pre-Commit Checks:**
   - Report follows template structure
   - All mandatory sections included
   - Formatting is consistent
   - Metrics are quantified

2. **Weekly Reviews:**
   - Verify all days with commits have reports
   - Check for missing startup reports (monthly cadence)
   - Validate unique content preservation
   - Update templates based on feedback

3. **Monthly Audits:**
   - Run compliance checker across all projects
   - Generate alignment summary reports
   - Update templates with new best practices
   - Archive outdated reports

### Template Evolution

**Version History:**
- **v1.0** (Oct 2025): Initial templates based on video_gen reference
- **v1.1** (Future): Add automation scripts integration
- **v1.2** (Future): Specialized extensions for common project types
- **v2.0** (Future): Interactive dashboard generation from reports

**Feedback Loop:**
1. Collect feedback from report authors
2. Identify common pain points
3. Add new sections/templates as needed
4. Deprecate unused sections
5. Release updated templates quarterly
