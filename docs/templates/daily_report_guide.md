# Daily Report Template - Comprehensive Usage Guide

## Purpose & Philosophy

The daily report template is designed to capture **actionable technical progress** in a structured, scannable format. It serves multiple audiences:

- **Future You**: Quickly recall context when returning to work
- **Team Members**: Understand progress and coordinate dependencies
- **Stakeholders**: Visibility into technical progress and challenges
- **Documentation**: Historical record for audits, postmortems, and knowledge sharing

---

## Section-by-Section Guide

### 1. Header Information

```markdown
# Daily Development Report - [Project Name]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Session Duration**: [HH:MM]
**Primary Focus**: [Brief 1-line description]
```

**Purpose**: Quick metadata for filtering and context-setting.

**Best Practices**:
- Use ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for sortability
- Track actual working hours, not calendar time
- Primary focus should be specific, not generic ("Implement OAuth flow" not "Backend work")

**Examples**:

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
```markdown
**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Session Duration**: 4:30
**Primary Focus**: Implement JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
```

‚ùå **POOR**:
```markdown
**Date**: October 11
**Session Duration**: all day
**Primary Focus**: worked on auth stuff
```

---

### 2. Executive Summary

**Purpose**: High-level snapshot for readers who need quick context without reading the entire report.

**Guidelines**:
- 2-3 sentences maximum
- Lead with most impactful outcome
- Include quantitative metrics when possible
- Mention critical blockers if they exist

**Template Structure**:
```
[Main accomplishment with metrics]. [Secondary outcome or technical achievement]. [Critical issue or next step if relevant].
```

**Examples**:

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
```markdown
Completed Phase 1 of UI/API alignment, standardizing error handling across 12 endpoints
and reducing average response time by 23% through Redis caching. Identified 3 critical
API contract mismatches requiring frontend updates before Phase 2. All unit tests passing
with coverage increased to 87%.
```

‚ùå **POOR**:
```markdown
Did some work on the API today. Made progress on several things. There are some issues
but we'll figure them out.
```

---

### 3. Session Objectives

**Purpose**: Define scope and measure completion against initial goals.

**Guidelines**:
- List 3-5 specific, measurable objectives
- Use status indicators: ‚úÖ Completed | üîÑ In Progress | ‚è∏Ô∏è Deferred | ‚ùå Blocked
- Include *why* objectives were deferred or blocked
- Align objectives with sprint/milestone goals

**Examples**:

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
```markdown
- ‚úÖ **Implement user authentication**: Complete JWT token generation and validation
- üîÑ **Add password reset flow**: Email service integration 60% complete
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Deploy to staging**: Deferred pending security review approval
- ‚ùå **Performance testing**: Blocked by missing test data fixtures
- ‚úÖ **Update API documentation**: OpenAPI spec updated for 3 new endpoints
```

‚ùå **POOR**:
```markdown
- Work on auth
- Fix bugs
- Write some tests
- Update docs
```

---

### 4. Work Completed

**Purpose**: Detailed technical record of what was built, changed, or fixed.

**Guidelines**:
- Group by feature/component, not by time
- Include file paths for traceability
- Add code snippets for novel patterns or key solutions
- Quantify impact (performance, UX, maintainability)
- 3-5 work items per session (combine small related changes)

**Structure for Each Item**:
```markdown
### [Feature/Component Name]
**Status**: [Completed | In Progress | Testing]
**Files Modified**: [Paths]
**Changes Made**: [Bullets]
**Code Example**: [Optional snippet]
**Impact**: [Measurable outcomes]
```

**Examples**:

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
```markdown
### JWT Authentication Service

**Status**: Completed
**Files Modified**:
- `/src/services/auth/jwt-service.ts`
- `/src/middleware/auth-middleware.ts`
- `/src/types/auth.types.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Implemented HS256 token signing with rotating secrets
- Added refresh token mechanism with 7-day expiry
- Created middleware for protected route authentication
- Added comprehensive error handling for expired/invalid tokens

**Code Example**:
```typescript
export class JWTService {
  generateTokenPair(userId: string): TokenPair {
    const accessToken = jwt.sign(
      { userId, type: 'access' },
      this.getActiveSecret(),
      { expiresIn: '15m' }
    );
    const refreshToken = jwt.sign(
      { userId, type: 'refresh' },
      this.getActiveSecret(),
      { expiresIn: '7d' }
    );
    return { accessToken, refreshToken };
  }
}
```

**Impact**:
- Reduces session management load by 90% (stateless auth)
- Enables secure mobile app authentication
- Improves security posture with short-lived access tokens
```

‚ùå **POOR**:
```markdown
### Auth Stuff
Fixed the login. Added some tokens. It works now.
```

### 5. Technical Decisions

**Purpose**: Document architectural choices for future reference and knowledge sharing.

**Guidelines**:
- Capture decisions that affect system design, not trivial choices
- Always include alternatives considered
- Be honest about trade-offs
- Link to ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) if they exist

**When to Document a Decision**:
- Choosing between libraries/frameworks
- Data structure or schema design
- API design patterns
- Caching strategies
- Security approaches
- Performance optimization techniques

**Examples**:

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
```markdown
### Decision: Redis vs In-Memory Cache for Session Storage

**Context**: Need to cache user session data to reduce database load. Application
runs in multi-instance deployment behind load balancer.

**Options Considered**:
1. **In-Memory (Node.js Map)**:
   - Pros: Zero latency, no external dependencies
   - Cons: No sharing between instances, lost on restart
2. **Redis**:
   - Pros: Shared across instances, persistent, pub/sub capabilities
   - Cons: Network latency (~1-3ms), additional infrastructure

**Decision**: Redis with 15-minute TTL

**Rationale**:
- Multi-instance deployment requires shared cache
- 1-3ms latency acceptable for session checks
- Redis persistence prevents login storms after deployments
- Future-proofs for horizontal scaling

**Trade-offs**:
- Added infrastructure complexity and cost (~$15/month for managed Redis)
- Slightly higher latency vs in-memory (acceptable for use case)
```

‚ùå **POOR**:
```markdown
### Decision: Use Redis
We need caching so I picked Redis because it's good.
```

---

### 6. Metrics & Performance

**Purpose**: Objective measurement of progress and system health.

**Guidelines**:
- Always include before/after comparisons
- Focus on metrics that matter to users or business
- Use consistent units and precision
- Add context for significant changes
- Include visualizations for trends

**Key Metric Categories**:
- **Code Quality**: Coverage, complexity, debt ratio
- **Performance**: Response time, throughput, resource usage
- **Reliability**: Error rates, uptime, recovery time
- **Productivity**: Story points, velocity, deployment frequency

**Examples**:

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
```markdown
### Performance Metrics
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Response Time (avg) | 245ms | 67ms | 73% faster |
| Response Time (p95) | 890ms | 156ms | 82% faster |
| API Calls/sec | 120 | 380 | 217% increase |
| Memory Usage | 450MB | 280MB | 38% reduction |

**Context**: Implemented Redis caching for user profile queries, which account for
60% of API traffic. Cache hit rate currently at 85%, expect to reach 95% as cache
warms up.

### Test Coverage Trend
```
Sprint 1: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë 78%
Sprint 2: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë 85%
Sprint 3: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà 92% (current)
Target:   ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà 90%
```
```

‚ùå **POOR**:
```markdown
### Metrics

### 7. Issues & Blockers

**Purpose**: Early warning system for problems requiring attention.

**Guidelines**:
- Separate critical issues from minor annoyances
- Always include root cause analysis (or "investigating" status)
- Define clear action items with owners
- Update status as issues progress
- Escalate blockers that will impact milestones

**Severity Levels**:
- **Critical**: System down, data loss, security breach
- **High**: Major feature broken, performance degraded >50%
- **Medium**: Minor feature broken, workaround exists
- **Low**: Cosmetic, edge case, future improvement

**Examples**:

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
```markdown
### Critical Issues

#### Issue 1: Race Condition in Concurrent Token Refresh
- **Severity**: High
- **Impact**: 2-3% of users experience "invalid token" errors during refresh
- **Root Cause**: Two simultaneous refresh requests invalidate each other's tokens
- **Status**: Solution Identified
- **Action Items**:
  - [ ] Implement token refresh locking mechanism (@backend-team, ETA: 2 days)
  - [ ] Add integration test for concurrent refresh scenario (@qa-team, ETA: 1 day)
  - [ ] Monitor error rates post-deployment (@devops-team, ongoing)

#### Issue 2: Database Connection Pool Exhaustion
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Impact**: API becomes unresponsive under load >500 req/sec
- **Root Cause**: Connection pool size (20) insufficient for traffic spikes
- **Status**: Fix in Progress
- **Action Items**:
  - [x] Increase pool size to 100 (deployed to staging)
  - [ ] Add connection pool monitoring to Grafana (@devops-team, ETA: 1 day)
  - [ ] Load test with 1000 req/sec to validate fix (@qa-team, ETA: 2 days)
```

‚ùå **POOR**:
```markdown
### Issues
- Auth is broken sometimes
- Database is slow
- Need to fix stuff
```

```

### Tables for Metrics
Tables provide structured comparison data:

```markdown
| Endpoint | Before | After | Change |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| GET /users | 120ms | 45ms | ‚Üì 63% |
| POST /auth | 80ms | 35ms | ‚Üì 56% |
| GET /posts | 200ms | 180ms | ‚Üì 10% |
```

### Mermaid Diagrams (Optional)
For complex flows or architecture, include Mermaid diagrams:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client] -->|Login Request| B[API Gateway]
    B -->|Validate| C[Auth Service]
    C -->|Generate| D[JWT Token]
    D -->|Return| A
```

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Too Vague
‚ùå "Fixed bugs and wrote some code"
‚úÖ "Resolved 3 critical authentication bugs: race condition in token refresh,
    null pointer in logout handler, and session timeout misconfiguration"

### 2. Missing Context
‚ùå "Improved performance by 50%"
‚úÖ "Reduced API response time from 240ms to 120ms (50% improvement) by implementing
    Redis caching for user profile queries, which constitute 60% of traffic"

### 3. No Measurables
‚ùå "Made the system better"
‚úÖ "Increased test coverage from 78% to 92%, reduced cyclomatic complexity by
    refactoring 4 functions from 15+ to <10, and eliminated 3 code smells
    identified by SonarQube"

### 4. Ignoring Trade-offs
‚ùå "Chose Redis because it's fast"
‚úÖ "Chose Redis over in-memory cache to support multi-instance deployment,
    accepting 1-3ms latency overhead for horizontal scalability"

### 5. Missing Action Items
‚ùå "There's a bug in the auth flow"
‚úÖ "Race condition in token refresh affects 2% of users. Action: Implement
    locking mechanism (Owner: @dev-team, ETA: 2 days, Priority: High)"
